Bioinformatic pipelines used in manuscript "A pan-genome data structure induced by pooled sequencing facilitates variant mining in heterogeneous germplasm", by Patrick A. Reeves and Christopher M. Richards are contained in the file ConsolidatedREADME.txt.

An animation showing short haplotype variation in diploid Patellifolia corresponding to single copy orthologous regions of the sugar beet genome is contained in the file EL10genomicscosMosaic.diff.maYES.mp4.  It is too large to be viewed at the GitHub web site so must be downloaded to view.  There are nine figures, one for each of the nine sugar beet chromosomes. The second field in the figure titles shows the start position of a 1000 bp fragment of the sugar beet genome.  The X axis shows the position within that fragment.  Short haplotype loci where there were major variant differences between the Patellifolia pools are shown.  Different colors indicate different variants (e.g. brown indicates a different sequence than red), shading within a color indicates relative frequency.  When short haplotype loci overlap, bars are tilted slightly to improve visualization.  Y axis labels: web GC, P. webbiana from Gran Canaria; pro T, P. procumbens from Tenerife; pro H, P. procumbens from El Hierro.
